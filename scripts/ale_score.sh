# This script runs ALE (github.com/sc932/ALE) to produce an ALE score for an assembly. ALE scores
# allow for the relative ranking of alternative assemblies of the same genome. Higher ALE scores
# (i.e. smaller magnitude, closer to zero) suggest a better assembly.

# This script takes four positional arguments:
# 1) assembly filename
# 2) Illumina read filename (first in pair)
# 3) Illumina read filename (second in pair)
# 4) number of threads to use for alignment

# It produces one file: the assembly filename with ".ale" appended to the end

# Example usage:
# ale_score.sh assembly.fasta reads/illumina_1.fastq.gz reads/illumina_2.fastq.gz 16
