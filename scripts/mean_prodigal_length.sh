# This script runs Prodigal (github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) to produce a mean protein length for an
# assembly. This allows for the relative ranking of alternative assemblies of the same genome.
# Higher mean protein lengths suggest a better assembly, as indel errors create frame-shifts which
# fragment coding sequences.

# This script takes one positional argument: assembly filename
# It produces one file: the assembly filename with ".prod" appended to the end

# Example usage:
# mean_prodigal_length.sh assembly.fasta

# Requirements: Prodigal and seqtk
